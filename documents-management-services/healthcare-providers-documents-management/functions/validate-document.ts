 * The validation logic for a document upload process could involve several checks to ensure the document meets specific criteria before proceeding with the upload. Here are some common validation checks:
 * File Type: Verify that the document is of an acceptable file type (e.g., PDF, DOCX).
 * File Size: Ensure the document does not exceed a maximum file size limit.
 * File Integrity: Check if the document is not corrupted or malformed.
 * Metadata Validation: Validate that required metadata fields are present and correctly formatted.
 * Virus Scan: Optionally, perform a virus scan on the document to ensure it is safe.
