# Audit As a Service Solution
The Audit As a Service Solution (AAAS)i s a robust and scalable system designed to manage, store, and analyze audit events within an organization. 

This solution provides comprehensive audit logging, tracking, and reporting capabilities, ensuring that all actions and transactions, required by industry regulations are recorded in a secure and tamper-proof manner. It is built to meet industry standards and regulatory requirements, providing insights into system activity and aiding in compliance efforts.

This folder contains all the necessary information about the architecture, implementation, recommended practices, and Postman collections for various business processes related to audit management.

## System Context Diagram
The following System Context Diagram provides a high-level overview of how the Audit As a Service Solution interacts with external entities, including users, third-party services, and other systems within the organization.

## Container Diagram
The Container Diagram provides a detailed view of the Audit As a Service Solution's architecture at the container level. It illustrates how various components within the system interact with each other to capture, store, and analyze audit events.

[TBD]

## Architecture Highlights:
1. **API Gateway:** Acts as the front door for all audit-related API requests, handling request validation, authorization, and routing to the appropriate backend services.
2. **Audit Storage:** Utilizes AWS DynamoDB to store audit events securely. The database is optimized for quick retrieval and querying based on various attributes like timestamps, event types, and user identifiers.
3. **Lambda Functions:** Executes specific tasks such as ingesting audit data, processing audit logs, and triggering alerts for anomalous activities.
4. **CloudWatch:** Provides real-time monitoring and logging of audit events, enabling administrators to gain insights into system activity and identify potential issues.
5. **S3 (Simple Storage Service):** Provides long-term storage for audit logs. S3 ensures durability and scalability for storing large volumes of audit data over extended periods, with configurable lifecycle policies for cost-effective management.
6. **KMS (Key Management Service):** Secures audit data by managing encryption keys, ensuring that sensitive information is protected both in transit and at rest.
