## Solutions

This repository focuses on implementing Cloud Serverless Audit Solutions using the **AWS** technology stack. It provides a detailed architecture and code examples tailored for AWS services, enabling scalable, automated, and real-time auditing across various business scenarios.

However, the principles and methodologies outlined here are broadly applicable and can be replicated using similar technologies available in other cloud platforms such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure. Each cloud provider offers equivalent services that can be used to achieve similar auditing and monitoring capabilities. For those using GCP or Azure, you can adapt the architecture by leveraging their respective serverless technologies and services to implement a comparable solution.

## Which solution to choose?

This repository has several options of Audit as a Service design and implementation. Ingestion via API Gateway, [Amazon Firehose](./audit-as-service-streaming-firehose/) and Amazon Kinesis Data Stream. Choose a repository as your project's code or architecture reference, based on following comparison table that contrasts **API Gateway**, **Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose**, and **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams** for ingestion architectures across various criteria:

| **Criteria** | **API Gateway** | [**Amazon Firehose**](./audit-as-service-streaming-firehose/)| **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams** |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Use Case**| Low-latency API interactions (e.g., REST, HTTP). Ideal for request/response models, real-time microservices communication. | Real-time data streaming to data lakes, analytics, or monitoring tools. Automatic scaling and data transformations. | Real-time data ingestion and custom stream processing. Low-latency, high throughput use cases (e.g., IoT, logs). |
| **Scalability**| Limited by backend integration and scaling API calls. Needs manual intervention for high throughput scaling. | Automatically scales to handle large volumes of data without user intervention. | Automatically scalable, but requires shard management for throughput control. |
| **Latency**| Generally low latency for individual requests. Ideal for synchronous operations. | Medium latency. Data can be batched, transformed, and then delivered to the destination. | Low latency. Designed for real-time data ingestion and fast processing. |
| **Data Transformation**| Not built-in. Requires a Lambda function or backend service for transformation. | Built-in with AWS Lambda integration. Supports format conversions, aggregations, or enrichment. | Transformation needs to be done via custom consumers reading from the stream (e.g., Lambda or Kinesis Analytics). |
| **Real-Time Processing**| Best suited for synchronous requests, not real-time streams. Limited event streaming support via WebSocket APIs. | Real-time delivery, but buffers data before processing. Best for near real-time ingestion into S3, Redshift, Elasticsearch, etc. | Designed for real-time ingestion. Supports millisecond-level processing for real-time analytics and responses. |
| **Data Delivery**| Requires manual handling of storage and destinations (e.g., via Lambda or backend services). | Automatically delivers data to S3, Redshift, Elasticsearch, or Splunk. Supports multiple destinations. | Data is delivered to consumers, which can then process or forward data to other services. |
| **Throughput**| Limited by API Gatewayâ€™s request quotas and backend capacity (up to 10,000 RPS). | High throughput. Automatically scales for large streams of data (GBs per second). | Extremely high throughput with managed shards (up to 1 MB/s input and 2 MB/s output per shard). |
| **Batching**| No native batching support. Requests are handled individually. | Supports batching with customizable buffer sizes and intervals. | No native batching, but multiple records can be processed in a single consumer request. |
| **Cost Model**| Pay per API request, making it costly for high-volume, streaming data. Backend services add extra costs. | Pay for the amount of data ingested and processed. Ideal for large-scale, continuous streams. | Pay per shard hour and data retrieval. Can get costly if not optimized (cost depends on number of shards). |
| **Error Handling & Retries**| Manual error handling via backend services. May require custom logic for retries. | Automatic retries with backup to S3 in case of delivery failure. Provides error logging via CloudWatch. | Requires custom consumer logic to handle retries or failures. AWS Lambda can manage retry logic if used as consumer. |
| **Data Retention**| No built-in retention. Must be handled in downstream services (e.g., storing in S3, DynamoDB). | Supports S3 backups, providing data retention for long-term storage. | Configurable data retention from 24 hours up to 7 days. Supports durable streams with persistence. |
| **Integration with AWS Services**| Easily integrates with many AWS services (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Step Functions). Requires additional setup. | Seamless integration with S3, Redshift, Elasticsearch, Splunk. Minimal configuration needed. | Tight integration with Kinesis Analytics, Lambda, and custom consumers. Supports AWS Glue for advanced analytics. |
| **Data Buffering**| No native buffering. Requests are processed individually. | Automatic buffering with configurable time intervals or size (up to 128 MB). | No buffering natively, but data can be consumed in batches by custom consumers. |
| **Data Duplication Prevention**| No built-in prevention. Must handle idempotency in backend logic. | Ensures reliable, once-per-second delivery. Supports S3 backups for ensuring no data loss. | Supports "exactly once" processing, but custom logic is required to handle duplicate events if consumers fail. |
| **Developer Effort**| Requires significant effort to design and maintain ingestion logic, scaling, and transformation. | Minimal effort for ingestion, scaling, and transformation. Built-in connectors simplify setup. | Requires custom consumers for processing, scaling, and fault tolerance management. More developer effort than Firehose. |
| **Data Integrity**| No built-in support. Must be manually managed. Backend services or queues are used to ensure reliability. | High reliability and fault tolerance with automatic retries and S3 backup. | High durability but requires managing shard capacity and consumer error handling. |
| **Data Volume Handling**| Suitable for low to medium volumes of data (rate-limited per second). | Designed for high-volume continuous streams with automatic scaling. | Suitable for high-volume streams, but you need to manage shard count for throughput scaling. |
| **Security**| Built-in security with AWS IAM, API Keys, and Lambda authorizers. | Fully managed security with data encryption at rest and in transit. Supports IAM roles and policies. | Supports encryption in transit and at rest. Data consumers must handle security and access controls. |
| **Retention & Replay**| No built-in replay support. Needs additional infrastructure for reprocessing. | Backup to S3 allows long-term retention and replay, but no native replay within Firehose. | Supports replay for up to 7 days. Can reprocess streams within the retention window. |

## Summary
- **API Gateway**: Ideal for **synchronous, request-response based interactions** with low data throughput. Suited for REST/HTTP APIs with manageable data volumes.
- **Amazon Firehose**: Best for **high-throughput streaming data pipelines** where you want a **managed solution** that **automatically scales** and **integrates easily** with AWS data lakes or analytics tools. Only **near real-time ingestion** is offered.
- **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams**: Excellent for **real-time ingestion** where you need **low-latency processing**, but it requires **manual shard management** and custom consumers for handling stream processing.
