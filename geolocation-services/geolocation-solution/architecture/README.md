# Architecture Overview

The Geolocation Solution is a robust system designed to manage and analyze geospatial data, similar to what GeoNames offers, within an organization. It provides precise tracking, mapping, visualization, and processing of location-based information such as geographical names, coordinates, administrative boundaries, and populated places. The solution is built to be scalable, secure, and compliant with industry regulations.

This folder contains all necessary information about the architecture, implementation, recommended practices, and Postman collections for various business processes related to geolocation and geographical data management.

## Architecture Highlights

### Technology Stack

1. **API Gateway:** Serves as the entry point for all API requests, directing them to the appropriate backend services. It handles request routing, validation, and authorization, ensuring that only authorized requests reach the system.

2. **Lambda Functions:** Handles specific, stateless tasks such as querying geographical data, processing location information, and performing other operational tasks. These functions are triggered by API requests and execute the necessary logic to fulfill the request.

3. **DynamoDB:** Utilizes AWS DynamoDB for managing and querying geospatial data, including geographical names, coordinates, and administrative boundaries. This component allows for efficient retrieval and management of location-based information based on various criteria.

4. **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** Ensures secure access to the API Gateway, Lambda functions, and DynamoDB. It enforces strict access controls, allowing only authorized users and services to interact with the geolocation data and system components.
