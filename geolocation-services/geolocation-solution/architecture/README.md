# Architecture Overview

The Document Management Solution is a comprehensive system designed to manage the entire lifecycle of documents within an organization. It provides secure storage, retrieval, sharing, and processing of various types of documents such as contracts, invoices, claims, and HR files. The solution is built to be scalable, secure, and compliant with industry regulations.

This folder contains all necessary information about the architecture, implementation, recommended practices and Postman collections for various business processes related to document management.

### Architecture Highlights:

- **API Gateway:** Serves as the entry point for all API requests, directing them to the appropriate backend services. It handles request routing, validation, and authorization.
- **Document Storage:** Utilizes AWS S3 for secure and scalable storage of document files. This component ensures that documents are stored reliably and can be accessed efficiently.
- **Metadata Database:** Employs AWS DynamoDB to manage and query metadata associated with documents. This allows for quick retrieval and management of document information based on various criteria.
- **Step Functions:** Orchestrates complex workflows involved in document processing. It coordinates multiple steps such as retrieval, processing, and notifications, ensuring each step is executed according to the defined sequence.
- **Lambda Functions:** Handles specific, stateless tasks such as generating pre-signed URLs, processing document metadata, and performing other operational tasks.
- **CloudWatch:** Provides monitoring and logging capabilities, allowing for real-time insights into system performance and detailed audit trails of system events.
- **KMS (Key Management Service):** Manages encryption keys to secure document data both at rest and in transit, ensuring compliance with security and privacy regulations.
